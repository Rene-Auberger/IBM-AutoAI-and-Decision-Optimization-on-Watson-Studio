# IBM-AutoAI-and-Decision-Optimization-on-Watson-Studio
AutoAI and DO

# Introduction
AutoAI for IBM Watson Studio helps automation of AI development for building machine learning models. Decision Optimization for Watson Studio brings prescriptive analytics capabilities to the Data Science teams and allows them to combine machine learning with descriptive analytics and deliver bottom-line impact to the business. Letâ€™s examine a business problem for conducting promotion planning. In this example, we look at the historical sales data that shows various product groups and effects on stock before and after promotion. In the 45 minutes for this product tour, we will learn about IBM Auto AI and Decision Optimization modeling assistant capabilities with Watson Studio. These capabilities are available in Watson Studio Premium on Cloud Pak for Data.

# Tools
**Watson Studio (WS)** is a comprehensive data science workbench. It is used to prepare and builds models with your choice of tool and run times. You can build models using open source codes or visual modeling.

**Watson Machine Learning (WML)** is a platform for deploying models. It supports deployment of AutoAI, SPSS, Decision optimization as well as open source models.

WS and WML support the entire machine learning lifecycle, which we will demonstrate in this lab
