# Create Decision optimization model

 Start to develop an optimization model.

 In the retail store the store manager is thinking to conduct a promotion to get rid of as much stock as possible. The promotion has some cost either because e.g. flyers have to be printed as well as there is a discount of the price involved in the promotion. The store manager has to decide which product group should be promoted, if due to the promotion more item is (possibly) sold than on stock then new products should be purchased. Of course the goal of the promotion is to maximize the extra profit minus the cost of promotion

### Step 1. Add storePrediction data to the project

You're ready to start setting up the optimization model and configure the data set and create an initial optimization model that you can run.

- Click the Add to Project button in the top-right corner. A window with all services and you can click the Decision Optimization Experiments tile. Give it a name. For the purposes of this demo, the name *PromotionOptimization*
- Click Create.The model builder is shown, which guides you through the steps in the model creation process. You start with the Select Data step on the right side. Click the browse hyperlink and select the store_predicted file.
- Click Import to import the selected data files into the project.Youâ€™re now in the Prepare data step in the model builder. In this step, you can review and edit the imported data files.
